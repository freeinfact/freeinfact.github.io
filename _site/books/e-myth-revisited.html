<p>I recently finished reading “The E Myth Revisited - Why most Small
Business Don’t Work and What to Do About It”, and these are my notes.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> - 4 ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>E-Myth: Entrepreneurs raising capital</li>
  <li>Turnkey revolution</li>
  <li>The business development process</li>
  <li>Predictable Business Development</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5</strong> - “Your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are.”</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> - Fatal assumption: “if you understand the technical work of a business,
you understand a business that does that technical work”</p>

<p><strong>28</strong> - Three-way battle inside ourselves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Entrepreneur
  - the future, focusing on the bigger vision</li>
  <li>The Technician
  - the present, focusing on how, not what or why</li>
  <li>The Manager
  - the past, cleaning up and documenting</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>33</strong> - “I wonder is the true work of the entrepreneurial personality.”</p>

<p><strong>35</strong> - 3 phases of a small business:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Infancy
  - the business and you are one and the same</li>
  <li>Adolescence
  - you decide to get some help</li>
  <li>Maturity
  - knows how it got here and how to get to where it wants to go</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>39</strong> - “It’s the work you’re not doing, the strategic work, the 
entrepreneurial work, that will lead your business forward.”</p>

<p><strong>40</strong> - “If your business depends on you, you don’t own a business-you have a job.”</p>

<p><strong>63</strong> - Businesses that get small again die</p>

<p><strong>65</strong> - A mature business works not because of you, but without you.</p>

<p><strong>74</strong> - Without a clear picture of the customer, no business can succeed.</p>

<p><strong>82</strong> - The business format franchise is built on the belief that the true product
of a business is not what it sells but how it sells it. The product of a business
is the business itself.</p>

<p><strong>86</strong> - The franchise prototype</p>

<p>Even if you don’t want to own a franchise, plan your business like one, because
franchises are reproducable money-making machines.</p>

<p><strong>91</strong> - 75% of franchises succeed, compared to only 20% of small independent businesses</p>

<p><strong>98</strong> - pretend you’ll franchise</p>

<p><strong>99</strong> - “Value is what people perceive”</p>

<p><strong>100</strong> - Dependency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>systems dependent
    <ul>
      <li>business success is in a system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>people dependent
    <ul>
      <li>does the business depend on the people it employs?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>102</strong> - impossible to depend on extraordinary people being extraordinary</p>

<p><strong>104</strong> - documentation is an affirmation</p>

<p><strong>106</strong> - Bring consistency to the experience</p>

<p><strong>107</strong> - Check out “why people buy” book</p>

<p><strong>118</strong> - It’s not the commodity that needs innovation but the process by
which it is sold.</p>

<p><strong>125</strong> - Check out “Marketing for business growth” book</p>

<p><strong>135</strong></p>
