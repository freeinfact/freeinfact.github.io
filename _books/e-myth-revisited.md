I recently finished reading "The E Myth Revisited - Why most Small
Business Don't Work and What to Do About It", and these are my notes.

**3** - 4 ideas:

1. E-Myth: Entrepreneurs raising capital
2. Turnkey revolution
3. The business development process
4. Predictable Business Development

**5** - "Your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are."

**13** - Fatal assumption: "if you understand the technical work of a business,
you understand a business that does that technical work"

**28** - Three-way battle inside ourselves:

1. The Entrepreneur
  - the future, focusing on the bigger vision
2. The Technician
  - the present, focusing on how, not what or why
3. The Manager
  - the past, cleaning up and documenting

**33** - "I wonder is the true work of the entrepreneurial personality."

**35** - 3 phases of a small business:

1. Infancy
  - the business and you are one and the same
2. Adolescence
  - you decide to get some help
3. Maturity
  - knows how it got here and how to get to where it wants to go

**39** - "It's the work you're not doing, the strategic work, the 
entrepreneurial work, that will lead your business forward."

**40** - "If your business depends on you, you don't own a business-you have a job."

**63** - Businesses that get small again die

**65** - A mature business works not because of you, but without you.

**74** - Without a clear picture of the customer, no business can succeed.

**82** - The business format franchise is built on the belief that the true product
of a business is not what it sells but how it sells it. The product of a business
is the business itself.

**86** - The franchise prototype

Even if you don't want to own a franchise, plan your business like one, because
franchises are reproducable money-making machines.

**91** - 75% of franchises succeed, compared to only 20% of small independent businesses

**98** - pretend you'll franchise

**99** - "Value is what people perceive"

**100** - Dependency:

- systems dependent
  - business success is in a system
- people dependent
  - does the business depend on the people it employs?

**102** - impossible to depend on extraordinary people being extraordinary

**104** - documentation is an affirmation

**106** - Bring consistency to the experience

**107** - Check out "why people buy" book

**118** - It's not the commodity that needs innovation but the process by
which it is sold.

**125** - Check out "Marketing for business growth" book
